      <h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
      <h3>
        As a <span>Web Developer</span>, I've had various experiences.<br />
        Here's a glimpse of my journey.
        <br />
        Throughout my journey as a web developer, I've encountered a diverse
        array of experiences that have shaped my skills and perspective. From
        collaborating on intricate e-commerce platforms to crafting sleek
        portfolio websites for clients across industries, each project has been
        a unique learning opportunity. These experiences have not only honed my
        technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of user-centric
        design principles and the importance of seamless functionality in the
        digital realm.
        <br />
        <br />
        Moreover, my journey has been enriched by the challenges and triumphs of
        working within dynamic teams. Whether brainstorming innovative solutions
        during intense hackathons or coordinating with fellow developers to
        troubleshoot complex coding issues, I've thrived in environments that
        foster collaboration and creative problem-solving. These interactions
        have not only enhanced my coding proficiency but also instilled in me
        the value of effective communication and adaptability in achieving
        project goals.
